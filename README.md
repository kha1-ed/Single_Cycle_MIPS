Single Cycle MIPS Processor

Introduction

A Single Cycle MIPS processor executes each instruction in a single clock cycle, making it easy to understand and implement. This repository provides a Verilog-based implementation of a Single Cycle MIPS processor and accompanying documentation to help you understand and experiment with this design.

Features

Complete Single Cycle MIPS processor implementation in Verilog.
Comprehensive set of supported MIPS instructions.
Modular design for easy understanding and modification.
Sample program to run on the processor.
Detailed documentation explaining the architecture and instruction set.

Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/kha1-ed/Single_Cycle_MIPS

Navigate to the project directory:

cd single-cycle-mips

Ensure you have a Verilog simulator and synthesis tool installed, such as Xilinx Vivado or ModelSim.

Run simulations or synthesize the design as per your requirements.

Usage

To use the Single Cycle MIPS processor:

Simulate the processor using your preferred Verilog simulator. Use the provided testbenches to verify its functionality.
Synthesize the design to run on an FPGA board or ASIC.
Refer to the Documentation for more detailed instructions and examples.

Instruction Set Architecture

The Single Cycle MIPS processor supports a subset of the MIPS instruction set. Find detailed information about the supported instructions and their formats in the Instruction Set Documentation.
